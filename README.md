## For Users: Submitting feedback for the GitHub Product Team, Client Teams, and Builders

### Feedback to the GitHub Product Team

If your feedback pertains to GitHub Copilot Extensions in general (e.g. bugs, feature requests) or the GitHub Marketplace (publishing, verifying, listing), please:
1. Select the "githubproduct" label and open a new issue in this repository
2. Fill out the [Extension Developer Survey](https://survey3.medallia.com/?Mxu02i-extensibility) for detailed feedback and feature requests

### Feedback to Client Teams

A client team is the team that owns the surface where users would interface with a Copilot Extension. Client teams that support GitHub Copilot Extensions today are Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Chat in GitHub.com, and Chat in GitHub Mobile. You can see a list of all supported clients [here](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/building-copilot-extensions/about-building-copilot-extensions#supported-clients-and-ides).

If your feedback is specific to Copilot Extensions in a specific IDE or surface (e.g. client side capabilities, IDE related bugs) please follow these steps:

1. **Identify the correct label**
   
3. **Create a GitHub Issue in this repository**
   - Navigate to the "Issues" tab in this repository.
   - Click on "New Issue" and describe your feedback in detail.
   - Apply the appropriate label using the IDE name.
     
4. **Engage with client teams**: After submitting your issue, the client team may respond to gather more details or provide updates. Keep an eye on the issue thread for any follow-up.
   
6. **Stay organized**: Ensure your feedback is directed to the correct client by applying the corresponding label. For status updates, you can turn on Issue notifications in the right-hand sidebar.

### Feedback to Builders

If you’re using a Copilot Extension and would like to provide **feedback directly to the builder**, please follow these steps:

1. **Identify the correct label**:
   - Each Copilot Extension listed in the GitHub Marketplace typically has a label corresponding to its slug name (part of the URL in its listing).
   - Use the slug name as the label if your feedback is intended for the publisher of that extension.

2. **Create a GitHub Issue in this repository**: 
   - Navigate to the "Issues" tab in this repository.
   - Click on "New Issue" and describe your feedback in detail.
   - Apply the appropriate label using the extension’s slug name.

3. **Engage with builderes**: After submitting your issue, the extension builders may respond to gather more details or provide updates. Keep an eye on the issue thread for any follow-up.

4. **Stay organized**: Ensure your feedback is directed to the specific Copilot Extension by applying the corresponding label. For status updates, you can turn on Issue notifications in the right-hand sidebar.

If you are unsure which label is most applicable for your feedback, please include the “githubproduct” label and our team will route your request. 

Your feedback is essential in helping builders, clients, and the GitHub Product team improve the overall Copilot Extensions experience during this public preview phase.
